<b>S</b></span>tress has nowadays become a part of people’s lives. To relieve
this stress, people have greater than ever expectations from personal care services they get. If you are a Salon &amp; Spa owner and think that your customer is

coming to your place only for a haircut, skin treatment, or just a manicure, you are wrong. People now consider their visit to the Salon &amp; Spa as not just a beautification process but a spiritual getaway. You don’t know which customer entered your Salon &amp; Spa to get a pedicure and their only intent was to uplift their soul and feel good about themselves.

> “Hospitality is a very wide field to talk about, so in this article I’ll share few tips, small things that will make a big impact on your customers’ experience”.

How your staff greets them, ambience of the waiting room, how well you understand customer requirements, and then precisely delivering what they wanted, everything is an experience.

- **How your staff greets them?** The ambience of your Salon &amp; Spa is crucial in making the first impression. The initial vibes that your customer feels when they enter is what stays with them. It’s important that you make these vibes as positive as possible as it has a sub-conscious effect on the customer.

- **Humans not Robots:** Train your staff to treat
  customers like family. Take special care that their
  interaction with the customer isn’t robotic and the overall
  interaction is as human as possible.

- **Remember ‘The Name’:** Regular customers don’t
  like to enter a Salon &amp; Spa and explain all their
  preferences again. Remember what they like, remember their
  dislikes, and most importantly, remember their name.

It’s time that you build your Salon &amp; Spa like a getaway for
your customers whenever they feel stressed in life. Go an extra
mile to make your customers feel great about themselves. Give
your opinions on what is good for them and what’s not, but be a
good listener.
